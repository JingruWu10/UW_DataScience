well, that was fun.  We started with an AIC of -543.19 and got it down to 454.92 by dropping engine locaiton, fuel type, drive wheels, number of doors, city mpg, and horsepower



GALTON MALES
start with NNN
1) drop father.sqr (lowest AIC)
2) drop mother (lowest AIC)
3) N0thing else helps <none> has best AIC
All remining coefficients (3) are significant (all have 3 stars)
Plots are similar/same except Residuals vs. Leverage, where the cooks distances are gone.

FOR JUPYTER
Well, that was fun.  The AIC is negative; so in this case, "bigger" AIC's (i.e. "more negative") is better. We started with an AIC of -560.02 and got it to -565.38 by dropping fuel.type, engine.location, stroke + compression.ratio, horsepower, peak.rpm.  The most significant features turned out to be height, curb weight, and if the Make was a BMW.
