There's a famous quote from comedian George Carline that says, "Think of how stupid the average person is, and realize half of them are stupider than that."  Really?  Maybe all of us are reall-really smart, except for that really dumb guy that pulls down the average. Or we're all idiots except for someone like  Stephen Hawking. I don't claim to be smarter than George, but I do believe he meant to say, â€œThink of how stupid the person of median-level inteligence is, and realize half of them are stupider than that." Of course, that makes the quote one standard deviation nerdier, but three sigmas less funny.
